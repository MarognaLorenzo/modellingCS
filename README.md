# MCS25 Project

1) To start the project web application, run `python set.py`. Then, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`.
2) The application will try to find `idp` binaries, and if it fails, provide the command or path in the `config.json` file.


## Configuration

By default, the app should work out of the box (if you have IDP installed on your system).
The `config.json` file allows you to specify a custom path to the IDP binaries, change the timeout limit (for executing IDP) and to change the port of the app if needed.

## Comunication

If you find a bug, please open an issue on the [GitLab issue page](https://gitlab.com/krr/mcs25-project/-/issues).
If you are not sure about creating an issue, you can send an email to [Djordje Markovic](mailto:dorde.markovic@kuleuven.be).

In case you have any doubts or questions regarding the project assignment, please send an email to all teaching assistants.
